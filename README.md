# 🌟 About Me

Hi, I’m Sherif, a Data Engineer with a strong foundation in Industrial Engineering and specialized in Data Engineering.
I hold a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) in Industrial Engineering from Canadian International College (CIC) and a Microsoft Data Engineering degree from Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI).
I am fascinated by how systems work, how processes can be optimized, and how the right information at the right time can change everything. That curiosity led me to Industrial Engineering, and later, to Data Engineering.
